Mogul JS is a JavaScript and jQuery Utility and Interface library that uses the Mogul CSS library for styling. The code attempts to stay stylistically consistent with Mogul AS, and the Mogul MVC, which extends it.

The main goal of Mogul JS is to create a UI library with as few dependancies as possible on itself or other JavaScript libraries. All components should work independantly.

Built with Aptana.
