MogulJS is a JavaScript and jQuery Utility and Interface library that uses the MogulCSS library for styling. The code attempts to stay stylistically consistent with MogulAS, and MogulPHP, which uses it.

The main goal of MogulJS is to create a UI library with as few dependancies as possible. All components should work independantly.
